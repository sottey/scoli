# Welcome to NolderMD

This app is a local notes system built around folders and Markdown.

What you are seeing:
- A tree of folders and notes on the left
- A note editor on the right

Try this:
1. Click another note in the tree
2. Come back here
3. Edit this note (changes save to disk)

Tip: The notes are just files on your computer.
